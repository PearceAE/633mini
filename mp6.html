<td><p><font face="arial" color="800080">Mini Project 6 was a bit of a challenge for me. Since my computer operates on Windows 10, Movie Maker was not available to me. I decided to make a video tour from the photos my husband and I took when we were in Scotland. I edited the photos and used the Photo app to string the photos into a video and then added music. I was limited with what I could do in the Photos apps and I wanted to keep the theme relatively consistent, so I used the blurred text transition to introduce the audience to new locations and points of interest. Additionally, I added some 3D effects (whirring smoke on the title page to look like will of the wisps, and arrow to point out where Nessie was swimming in Loch Ness, and a train at the viaduct). In addition to this, I added text edits to several of the photos to provide more information to the viewer about the photo. Once I got the video where I liked it, I opened it in Movie Maker 10 and added more traditional transitions at the beginning and the end of the video and then I created a layered effect where the video would lay within a smaller window with a blurred photo in the background. Once my video was completed I added it to my Mini Project 6 page and then ran it through the validator.</font></p></td>
